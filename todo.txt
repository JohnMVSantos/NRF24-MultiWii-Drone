TODO:

2) Sphinx documentation of the drone tutorial with steps also inlcude frame design with mounting holes.
3) Final sphinx documentation converted into a PDF.
4) Add future section for future updates to the drone. 

v1.0 -> prototype 1.0: Initial attempt
v1.1 -> prototype 1.1: design changes to fix the issues - make it fly
v2.0 -> prototype 2.0: Incorporatte FPV camera - make it see
v3.0 -> prototype 3.0: Add AI detections. 

Key learnings
--------------
Battery 25C works for this drone
Better to use solder with lead, but prone to contamination (ensure proper storage)
Check NRF24 radio communication first before assembling the drone. Always test parts individually.
Keep it simple and complexity should not come first. Achieve minimum functionality for initial development
5V 16MHz Arduino Pro Mini is sufficient and better to buy from Robojax
Better to buy MPU6050 from DFRobot
Better to place MPU6050 away from electrical noise of the Arduino and other electrical components.
Keep electrical components away from the conductive carbon fiber frame and insulate properly.
Thin kapton tapes do not provide as much insulation as actual electrical tape. Though electrical tape is heavier. 
Capacitors helps reduce power fluctuations and noise.
